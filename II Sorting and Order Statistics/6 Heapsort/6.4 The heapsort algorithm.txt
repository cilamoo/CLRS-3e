6.4 The heapsort algorithm

HEAPSORT(A)
1 BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A)
2 for i = A.length downto 2
3     exchange A[1] with A[i]
4     A.heap-size = A.heap-size - 1
5     MAX-HEAPIFY(A,1)

The HEAPSORT procedure takes time O(nlgn), since the call to BUILD-MAXHEAP
takes time O(n) and each of the n-1 calls to MAX-HEAPIFY takes
time O(lgn).
