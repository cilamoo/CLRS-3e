The i th order statistic of a set of n elements is the i th smallest element. For
example, the minimum of a set of elements is the first order statistic (i = 1),
and the maximum is the nth order statistic (i = n). A median, informally, is
the “halfway point” of the set. When n is odd, the median is unique, occurring at
i = (n+1)/2. When n is even, there are two medians, occurring at i = n/2 and
i = n/2+1. Thus, regardless of the parity of n, medians occur at i = ⌊(n+1)/2⌋ 
(the lower median) and i = ⌈(n+1)/2⌉  (the upper median). For simplicity in
this text, however, we consistently use the phrase “the median” to refer to the lower
median.

This chapter addresses the problem of selecting the i th order statistic from a
set of n distinct numbers.

We can solve the selection problem in O(nlgn) time, since we can sort the numbers
using heapsort or merge sort and then simply index the i th element in the
output array.
