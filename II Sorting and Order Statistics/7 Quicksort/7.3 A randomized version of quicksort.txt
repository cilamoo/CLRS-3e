7.3 A randomized version of quicksort

random sampling:
We do so by first exchanging element A[r] with an element chosen at random
from A[p..r]. By randomly sampling the range p,...,r, we ensure that the pivot
element x = A[r] is equally likely to be any of the r - p +1 elements in the
subarray.

RANDOMIZED-PARTITION(A,p,r)
1 i = RANDOM(p,r)
2 exchange A[r] with A[i]
3 return PARTITION(A,p,r)

RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT(A,p,r)
1 ifp < r
2     q = RANDOMIZED-PARTITION(A,p,r)
3     RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT(A,p,q-1)
4     RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT(A,q+1,r)
