8.3 Radix sort

In a typical computer, which is a sequential random-access machine, we sometimes
use radix sort to sort records of information that are keyed by multiple fields.
For example, we might wish to sort dates by three keys: year, month, and day.

1 for i = 1 to d
2 use a stable sort to sort array A on digit i
