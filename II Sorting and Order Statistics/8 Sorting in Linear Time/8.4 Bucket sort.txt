8.4 Bucket sort
//输入是由随机过程生成, 均匀分布且独立在区间(0,1]
Bucket sort assumes that the input is drawn from a uniform distribution and has an
average-case running time of O(n). Like counting sort, bucket sort is fast because
it assumes something about the input. Whereas counting sort assumes that the input
consists of integers in a small range, bucket sort assumes that the input is generated
by a random process that distributes elements uniformly and independently over
the interval (0,1].

BUCKET-SORT(A)
1 let B[0..n-1] be a new array
2 n = A.length
3 for i = 0 to n-1
4     make B[i] an empty list 
5 for i = 1 to n
6     insert A[i] into list B[n⌊A[i]⌋]
7 for i = 0 to n-1
8     sort list B[i] with insert sort 
9 concatenate the lists B[0],B[1].....B[n-1] together in order 

Even if the input is not drawn from a uniform distribution, bucket sort may still
run in linear time. As long as the input has the property that the sum of the squares
of the bucket sizes is linear in the total number of elements.
