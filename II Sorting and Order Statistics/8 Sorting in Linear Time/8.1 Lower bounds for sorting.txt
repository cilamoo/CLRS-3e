8.1 Lower bounds for sorting

1.The decision-tree model
A decision tree is a full binary tree that represents the comparisons between elements that
are performed by a particular sorting algorithm operating on an input of a given
size.

2.A lower bound for the worst case
The length of the longest simple path from the root of a decision tree to any of
its reachable leaves represents the worst-case number of comparisons that the corresponding
sorting algorithm performs. Consequently, the worst-case number of
comparisons for a given comparison sort algorithm equals the height of its decision
tree. A lower bound on the heights of all decision trees in which each permutation
appears as a reachable leaf is therefore a lower bound on the running time of any
comparison sort algorithm. The following theorem establishes such a lower bound

Theorem 8.1
Any comparison sort algorithm requires Î©(nlgn) comparisons in the worst case.

Corollary 8.2
Heapsort and merge sort are asymptotically optimal comparison sorts.
