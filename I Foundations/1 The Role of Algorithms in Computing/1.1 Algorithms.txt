1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing

An algorithm is said to be correct if, for every input instance, it halts with the
correct output.

2.Hard problems

Why are NP-complete problems interesting? First, although no efficient algorithm
for an NP-complete problem has ever been found, nobody has ever proven that an 
efficient algorithm for one cannot exist. In other words, no one knows
whether or not efficient algorithms exist for NP-complete problems. Second, the
set of NP-complete problems has the remarkable property that if an efficient algorithm
exists for any one of them, then efficient algorithms exist for all of them. This
relationship among the NP-complete problems makes the lack of efficient solutions
all the more tantalizing. Third, several NP-complete problems are similar, but not
identical, to problems for which we do know of efficient algorithms. Computer
scientists are intrigued by how a small change to the problem statement can cause
a big change to the efficiency of the best known algorithm.
