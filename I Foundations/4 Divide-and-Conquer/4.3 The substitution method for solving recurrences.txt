The substitution method for solving recurrences comprises two steps:
1. Guess the form of the solution.
2. Use mathematical induction to find the constants and show that the solution
works.

Mathematical induction now requires us to show that our solution holds for the
boundary conditions. Typically, we do so by showing that the boundary conditions
are suitable as base cases for the inductive proof.

1.Making a good guess
Fortunately,though, you can use some heuristics to help you become a good guesser. You
can also use recursion trees, which we shall see in Section 4.4, to generate good
guesses.

If a recurrence is similar to one you have seen before, then guessing a similar
solution is reasonable.

Another way to make a good guess is to prove loose upper and lower bounds on
the recurrence and then reduce the range of uncertainty.

2.Subtleties
Sometimes you might correctly guess an asymptotic bound on the solution of a
recurrence, but somehow the math fails to work out in the induction. The problem
frequently turns out to be that the inductive assumption is not strong enough to
prove the detailed bound. If you revise the guess by subtracting a lower-order term
when you hit such a snag, the math often goes through.

When proving an upper bound by induction, it may actually be
more difficult to prove that a weaker upper bound holds, because in order to prove
the weaker bound, we must use the same weaker bound inductively in the proof.

3.Avoiding pitfalls
The error is that we have not proved the exact form of the
inductive hypothesis

4.Changing variables
Sometimes, a little algebraic manipulation can make an unknown recurrence similar
to one you have seen before.
