4.4 The recursion-tree method for solving recurrences

Although you can use the substitution method to provide a succinct proof that
a solution to a recurrence is correct, you might have trouble coming up with a
good guess. Drawing out a recursion tree, as we did in our analysis of the merge
sort recurrence in Section 2.3.2, serves as a straightforward way to devise a good
guess. In a recursion tree, each node represents the cost of a single subproblem
somewhere in the set of recursive function invocations. We sum the costs within
each level of the tree to obtain a set of per-level costs, and then we sum all the
per-level costs to determine the total cost of all levels of the recursion.

A recursion tree is best used to generate a good guess, which you can then verify
by the substitution method. When using a recursion tree to generate a good guess,
you can often tolerate a small amount of “sloppiness,” since you will be verifying
your guess later on. If you are very careful when drawing out a recursion tree and
summing the costs, however, you can use a recursion tree as a direct proof of a
solution to a recurrence.
