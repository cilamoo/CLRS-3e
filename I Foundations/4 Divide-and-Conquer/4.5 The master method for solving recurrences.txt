4.5 The master method for solving recurrences

The master method provides a “cookbook” method for solving recurrences of the
form
T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)(4.20)
where a ≥ 1 and b > 1 are constants and f(n) is an asymptotically positive
function. To use the master method, you will need to memorize three cases, but
then you will be able to solve many recurrences quite easily, often without pencil
and paper.

The recurrence (4.20) describes the running time of an algorithm that divides a
problem of size n into a subproblems, each of size n=b, where a and b are positive
constants. The a subproblems are solved recursively, each in time T(n/b). The
function f(n) encompasses the cost of dividing the problem and combining the
results of the subproblems.
