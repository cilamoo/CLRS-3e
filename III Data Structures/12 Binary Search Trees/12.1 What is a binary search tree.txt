12.1 What is a binary search tree?

//节点的属性：key,left,right,parent
We can represent such a tree by a linked data structure in which
each node is an object. In addition to a key and satellite data, each node contains
attributes left, right, and p that point to the nodes corresponding to its left child,
its right child, and its parent, respectively. If a child or the parent is missing, the
appropriate attribute contains the value NIL. The root node is the only node in the
tree whose parent is NIL.

//二叉搜索树的属性：一个节点的左子树的节点的key都小于等于该节点的key,一个节点的右子树的所有节点的key
//大于等于该节点的key
The keys in a binary search tree are always stored in such a way as to satisfy the
binary-search-tree property:
Let x be a node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the left subtree
of x, then y.key ≤ x.key. If y is a node in the right subtree of x, then
y.key ≥ x.key.

The binary-search-tree property allows us to print out all the keys in a binary
search tree in sorted order by a simple recursive algorithm, called an inorder tree
walk. This algorithm is so named because it prints the key of the root of a subtree
between printing the values in its left subtree and printing those in its right subtree.
Similarly, a preorder tree walk prints the root before the values in either subtree,
and a postorder tree walk prints the root after the values in its subtrees

INORDER-TREE-WALK(x)
1 if x ≠ NIL
2     INORDER-TREE-WALK(x.left)
3     print x.key
4     INORDER-TREE-WALK(x.right)

It takes Θ(n) time to walk an n-node binary search tree.

Theorem 12.1
If x is the root of an n-node subtree, then the call INORDER-TREE-WALK(x)
takes Θ(n) time.
