We can break the process of augmenting a data structure into four steps.
1. Choose an underlying data structure.
2. Determine additional information to maintain in the underlying data structure.
3. Verify that we can maintain the additional information for the basic modifying
   operations on the underlying data structure.
4. Develop new operations.

Augmenting red-black trees
Theorem 14.1 (Augmenting a red-black tree)
Let f be an attribute that augments a red-black tree T of n nodes, and suppose that
the value of f for each node x depends on only the information in nodes x, x.left,
and x.right, possibly including x.left.f and x.right.f. Then, we can maintain the
values of f in all nodes of T during insertion and deletion without asymptotically
affecting the O(lgn) performance of these operations.
