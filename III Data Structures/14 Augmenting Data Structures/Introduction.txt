Some engineering situations require no more than a “textbook” data structure—
such as a doubly linked list, a hash table, or a binary search tree—but many
others require a dash of creativity. Only in rare situations will you need to create
an entirely new type of data structure, though. More often, it will suffice to
augment a textbook data structure by storing additional information in it. You can
then program new operations for the data structure to support the desired application.
Augmenting a data structure is not always straightforward, however, since the
added information must be updated and maintained by the ordinary operations on
the data structure.
