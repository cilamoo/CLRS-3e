11.1 Direct-address tables

Direct addressing is a simple technique that works well when the universe U of
keys is reasonably small.
//对象的key就是索引, 索引就是key
DIRECT-ADDRESS-SEARCH(T,k)
1 return T[k]

DIRECT-ADDRESS-INSERT(T,x)
1 T[x.key] = x

DIRECT-ADDRESS-DELETE(T,x)
1 T[x.key] = NIL

Moreover, it is often unnecessary to store the key of the object, since if we have the index of an object
in the table, we have its key.
