21 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets

Some applications involve grouping n distinct elements into a collection of disjoint
sets. These applications often need to perform two operations in particular: finding
the unique set that contains a given element and uniting two sets. This chapter
explores methods for maintaining a data structure that supports these operations.

21.1 Disjoint-set operations
operations:
MAKE-SET(x) creates a new set whose only member (and thus representative)
is x. Since the sets are disjoint, we require that x not already be in some other
set.

UNION(x,y) unites the dynamic sets that contain x and y, say Sx and Sy, into a
new set that is the union of these two sets.

FIND-SET(x) returns a pointer to the representative of the (unique) set containing
x.

An application of disjoint-set data structures
One of the many applications of disjoint-set data structures arises in determining
the connected components of an undirected graph.

When the edges of the graph are static—not changing over time—we can compute the connected
components faster by using depth-first search (Exercise 22.3-12). Sometimes, however, the edges
are added dynamically and we need to maintain the connected components as each edge is added. In
this case, the implementation given here can be more efficient than running a new depth-first search
for each new edge.

CONNECTED-COMPONENTS(G)
1 for each vertex v ∈ G.V
2     MAKE-SET(v)
3 for each edge (u,v) ∈ G.E
4     if FIND-SET(u) ≠ FIND-SET(v)
5         UNION(u,v)

SAME-COMPONENT(u,v)
1 if FIND-SET(u) == FIND-SET(v)
2     return TRUE
3 else return FALSE
