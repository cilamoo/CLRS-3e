23 Minimum Spanning Trees

We can easily make each of them run in time O(ElgV) using ordinary binary heaps. By using
Fibonacci heaps, Prim’s algorithm runs in time O(E + VlgV), which improves
over the binary-heap implementation if |V| is much smaller than |E|.

The two algorithms are greedy algorithms.

The phrase “minimum spanning tree” is a shortened form of the phrase “minimum-weight spanning
tree.” We are not, for example, minimizing the number of edges in T , since all spanning trees have
exactly |V| - 1 edges by Theorem B.2.

The first algorithm, due to Kruskal, is similar to the connected-components algorithm 
from Section 21.1. The second, due to Prim, resembles Dijkstra’s shortest-paths algorithm (Section 24.3).

Because a tree is a type of graph, in order to be precise we must define a tree in
terms of not just its edges, but its vertices as well.
