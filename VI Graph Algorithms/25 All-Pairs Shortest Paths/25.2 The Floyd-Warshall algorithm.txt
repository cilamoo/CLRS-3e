25.2 The Floyd-Warshall algorithm

Negative-weight edges may be present, but we assume that there are no
negative-weight cycles.

1.The structure of a shortest path

1)If k is not an intermediate vertex of path p, then all intermediate vertices of
path p are in the set {1,2,...,k-1}

2)If k is an intermediate vertex of path p, then we decompose p into i ——> k ——> j
