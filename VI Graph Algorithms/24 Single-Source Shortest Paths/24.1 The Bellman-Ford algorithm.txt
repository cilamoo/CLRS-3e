24.1 The Bellman-Ford algorithm

The Bellman-Ford algorithm solves the single-source shortest-paths problem in
the general case in which edge weights may be negative.

INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G,s)
1 for each vertex v ∈ G.V
2     v.d = ∞
3     v.π = NIL
4 s.d = 0 

RELAX(u,v,w)
1 if v.d > u.d + w(u,v)
2     v.d = u.d + w(u,v)
3     v.π = u 

BELLMAN-FORD(G,w,s)
1 INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G,s)
2 for i = 1 to |G.V|-1
3     for each edge (u,v) ∈ G.E 
4         RELAX(u,v,w)
5 for each edge (u,v) ∈ G.E
6     if v.d > u.d + w(u,v)
7         return FALSE
8 return TRUE

The Bellman-Ford algorithm runs in time O(VE), since the initialization in
line 1 takes Θ(V) time, each of the |V|-1 passes over the edges in lines 2–4
takes Θ(E) time, and the for loop of lines 5–7 takes O(E) time.
