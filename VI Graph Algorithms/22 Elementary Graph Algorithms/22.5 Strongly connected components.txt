22.5 Strongly connected components

A strongly connected component of a directed graph G = (V,E) is a maximal set of vertices 
C ∈ V such that for every pair of vertices u and v in C, we have both u → v and v → u; 
that is, vertices u and v are reachable from each other.  

//DFS(G), 计算GT, 按u.f递减再调用DFS(GT)
STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS(G)
1 call DFS(G) to compute finishing times u.f for each vertex u
2 compute GT
3 call DFS(GT), but in the main loop of DFS, consider the vertices
       in order of decreasing u.f (as computed in line 1)
4 output the vertices of each tree in the depth-first forest formed in line 3 as a
        separate strongly connected component

//这些分量构成的图是dag, 不然，分量之间又构成分量 
The key property is that the component graph is a dag.

Each edge in GT that goes between different strongly connected components goes from a component with an earlier finishing
time (in the first depth-first search) to a component with a later finishing time.

Corollary 22.15
Let C and C' be distinct strongly connected components in directed graph G = (V,E). 
Suppose that there is an edge (u,v) ∈ ET, where u ∈ C and v ∈ C'. Then
f(C) < f(C')
